# Association Rula Mining and Visualization 

FPTree Growth based AR Mining (Data ingestion, Conditioning, Rule Extraction and Visualization) from a text corpus or transaction database. 

Application of AR Minining to a transaction database is commonplace. The FPTreeViz is a pedagogical tool for educators as well as data mining practioners to see through the rules a dynamic graph.

A promising application of AR mining is to anlayse text corpus in terms of the vocabulary (Universe of Discourse) and its interrelations. The concept is very simple, if two words co-occur in a sentence N number of times then they must be related. How can AR Mining help explore the relationships among words used in a given book or social media. 

As the number of associations grow, it becomes intractable and complex to perform any meaningful anlaysis with ease. The FPTreeViz will provide lightweight visualization engine (based on D3JS[https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045]) and a SOA for web users to upload a corpus and text and operate on basic operation of dynamically configurable graph.
